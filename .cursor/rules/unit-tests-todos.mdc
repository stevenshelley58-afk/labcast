Testing rules:
- Test are colocated as closely as possible to the code they are testing in a `__tests__` directory.
- We only test if/then logic
- A ‘when’ should indicate a describe block, and then we will out the todos.
- Don’t test implementation details, only the public API.

- DO NOT WRITE THE ACTUAL TESTING, ONLY THE TODOS.
- Propose only a spec test of todos:

Example:
```ts
describe(“Todo List”, () => {
    describe(“when a todo is added”, () => {
        it.todo(“adds a todo”);
    });
});
```
