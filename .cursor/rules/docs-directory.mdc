description: When writing documentation for the repository
alwaysApply: false

DIRECTIVES:
- Documentation directories should be named "docs" (lowercase)
- Documentation files should use CAPITAL LETTERS with hyphens (e.g., GETTING-STARTED.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)
- This follows the convention of treating documentation as a special top-level concern
- Apply this to any new documentation directories created in the project
