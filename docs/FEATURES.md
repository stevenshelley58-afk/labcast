# Key Features

## 🎯 Framework Integration

- **Agno**: Automatically downloads `.cursorrules` and `llms.txt`
- **Mastra**: Configures Mastra MCP for real-time documentation

## 🧪 LangWatch Integration

- **Prompt CLI**: Manage versioned prompts
- **Scenario Testing**: End-to-end agent testing
- **Evaluations**: Measure component performance
- **MCP Server**: Expert guidance built into your coding assistant

## 🔧 MCP Tool Integration

- **Smithery Toolbox** (optional): When you provide a Smithery API key during setup, your coding agent gets automatic access to MCP tools for enhanced capabilities
- Auto-configured in `.mcp.json` for seamless integration
- Your coding assistant can discover and use tools to help build your agent

## 🤖 Coding Assistant Setup

Your coding assistant (e.g., Claude Code, Cursor, Kilocode CLI) is:
- **Automatically launched** after project setup with initial prompt
- Pre-configured with framework-specific knowledge (via MCP or docs)
- Loaded with LangWatch best practices
- Equipped with prompt management expertise
- Set up with testing methodologies
- Auto-detected - the CLI shows which assistants are installed on your system

## 📊 Agent Testing Pyramid

Better Agents enforces a comprehensive testing methodology:

1. **Unit Tests** - Test deterministic components
2. **Evaluations** - Measure and optimize probabilistic components using Jupyter notebooks
3. **Scenario Tests** - End-to-end validation with the Scenario framework

This ensures your agent is thoroughly tested and production-ready from day one.
